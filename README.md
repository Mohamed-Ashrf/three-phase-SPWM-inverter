# three-phase-SPWM-inverter
it's a three phase SPWM inverter using ATMEGA controller, this code is applied to atmega128 but you can apply it to any atmega micro-controller as long it has 3 channel 16-bit timer, and there are a lot.

# simulink file
in this file you would find a representation of the code using matlab for demonstration purposes and you can adjust your parameters in the simulation like applying induction motor or load and changing the voltage and the carrier frequancy.

# proteus file
this file is simulating the code using proteus software, i'm using atmega128 but you can adjust the code to make it work at atmel-2549 for example, just open the data sheet and wire up the terminals of the scope right and adjust the registers according to the datasheet.

# SOON
soon i will make as a closed loop V/f driver and the hardware of the driver, actually it's made to be one but i'm commenting out the needed code, and i'll upload the description of the code and hope that i wouold be able to make a video just stay tuned.....
